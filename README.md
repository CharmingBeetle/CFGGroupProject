Project Presentation 


Our team made up of Alexandra, Nina and Aisha, decided to do our final Code First Girls Project on Pokémon Top Trumps using Python. The game works by first asking the user what the goal score would be to win the game and looping through the game until the winning score is achieved.

Pokémon cards are assigned at random from the APi and the computer compares the STAT values. If the same card is drawn, it’s changed for another. If the user STAT is higher than computer, user scores and wins. And vice Versa. If STATs are equal, game draws and scores stay the same.

In our game, the STATs available to the user include: name, id, height, weight, base experience.


Explaining the code

As you can see, the game begins by asking how many points our goal is. For this round, we’ll input the best out of three. Two cards have been drawn from which, I get two choose one. I’m then notified what the computer chose. I’ll input the stats with the highest number to improve my chances of winning. The stats are compared, and the scoreboard is updated.

This game has now looped and continues following the same process as before. 

The game concludes with asking if we would like to play again, in this instance, No – and prints ‘Thank you for playing! Goodbye for now'.

After playing the game – Our experience refers to below:

Initially, we had difficulty understanding how we wanted our game to play out. However, we worked together to create a mind map below which allowed us to visualize and improve our game and user experience.

This helped us prioritise our requirements of Must, Should, Could and Wonts . 

Overall, we’re happy to have completed the required tasks and add on extensions like: Allowing user to choose between two cards, adding a STAT,  allowing the computer to choose a STAT to compare and the player with the most points winning. Thank you for watching us play our game, explain our code and experience making this project. We hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions, please ask away!
